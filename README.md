# VeryUnofficialTensorstoreGuide

A very unofficial guid to the [Tensorstore](https://github.com/google/tensorstore) library.

The goal of this unofficial guide is to provide my experiences using the library and hopefully
make it more accessible for you to use in your project.

### Brief overview

Tensorstore is library that allows for efficient access and manipulation of volumetric data. It 
has drivers for a variety of modern file formats, such as [ZArr](https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) as well as support for a number of compression codecs. 

The library is primarily written in modern C++, and includes a set of Python bindings.
